        	<h4>Benefits</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Learning to take care of a horse (grooming, tacking up, cleaning up) teaches responsibility </li>
				<li>Teaches sportsmanship</li>
				<li>You learn to trust a horse, and you learn how to make the horse trust you</li>
				<li>Riding helps balance in everyday life</li>
				<li>Jumping feels like flying: who doesn't want to fly?</li>
				<li>You are able to forget all your other worries and just focus on riding</li>

			<h4>Finding the Right Barn</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Tour the barn first: see how the horses are treated, is the barn well maintained?</li>
				<li>Meet the trainers: do you feel respected? Do you think this trainer will be able to get you to the level you want to be at?</li>
				<li>Think about where you want to end up: do you want to be competing at a high level eventually? Is the barn going to allow that?</li>
