        	<h4>Why I Love Windermere</h4>
		<p>
			Although I have many previous places to thank for fostering my initial love of horses, it wasn’t until I began to ride at <a href="http://windermereequestrian.com">Windermere Equestrian Center</a> that I finally felt that I was where I belonged (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/windermereequestriancenter/?fref=ts">Windermere Facebook Page</a>).  I immediately fell in love with the horses I was riding, I finally felt like I was learning what I wanted, and there was a real sense of community that I was missing at all the previous barns I had ridden at.  For the first time in my time as a rider, I was able to be around other girls my age at the barn.  I loved the fact that we would have social events like taking the horses christmas caroling around the neighborhood and our year end awards banquet.  Although I never really got close with the close knit group of girls (mainly because I never owned a horse like they did, and consequently didn't spend as much time with them) I still just loved that there was never dull moment.  There aren't as many social events at the barn now, but that doesn't change the fact that I love Windermere and will always call it home.

	        <h4>Trainers</h4>
			<p>
				I have ridden with a few different trainers during my time at Windermere. I began taking lessons with Cassie every Sunday, but unfortunately shortly after I started those lessons the lesson time just didn't work so I started taking lessons with Lindsey after school on Fridays instead.  I loved my lessons with Lindsey.  She was the trainer that finally got me to be 100% comfortable while cantering, and I first learned to jump with her.  After a couple years though, Lindsey decided to move to Washington DC to live with her fiancé.  Jen, the owner of the barn, tried to take over my lesson, but the times didn't work out agian, and I switched back into the Sunday lesson with Cassie.  Save for a few makeup lessons here and there with Jen and a couple of the other associate trainers at the barn, I stayed in that Sunday lesson until the week before I left for college, and I still go back and ride in it while I'm home over breaks.  I have learned how to really be a confident rider with the help of Cassie.  She has helped me work through a lot of the bad habits that I have (and continues too), she has taught me how to ride multiple types of horses (some that I've liked more than others...), and I feel like she really cares about me both as a rider and a person.  I might switch into lessons with Jen this summer, just because I want to advance more and I feel like Jen is the one to help me with that, as she trains the top riders at the barn.  At the same time however, I love Cassie and my Sunday lesson and I don't want to leave, so I have a decision to make.

		<h4>Showing</h4>
		<p>
			When I first started taking riding lessons, it was always my dream to compete and enter horse shows.  I never thought I would be able to, as I didn't own my own horse, but Windermere hosts a few horse shows over the summer, and allows riders to compete on school horses.  I remember how excited I was for my first show.  I was riding my favorite horse at the time, Misty, and we were competing in the pole pile divison, where we "jumped" 3 jump poles stacked into a little obstacle.  I felt so cool, and I still have my ribbons from the show.  Of course, I jump higher obstacles now (I have competed up to 2 foot, although I jump higher in lessons), but it's still the same drill: wake up at 5 am, drive to the barn, school in the morning, and then wait around until it's time for you to show.  Typically I jump a few courses, and then I have a flat class, where the judge calls out what they want the riders to do and then judges us on how our position and our horses look. Show days are extreamly long and exhausting, but they are the only thing I would ever willingly wake up at the crack of dawn for.  I am always sad when a show is over, and I can't wait for the next one. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QILCDxMMfvA">video</a> of me on Fancy at the show I did this past summer. We got 2nd place for this course.

His canter is amazing, and although his jump is a little bit different than a lot of other horses, once you get used to it its wonderful.  Desi is super sweet and lovey, and I love him.</a>

Sugar is a quarterhorse, and like Desi, is very comfortable.  She is a little lazy about jumping, but I really want to ride her more over the summer and see where we can get as a team.</a>
