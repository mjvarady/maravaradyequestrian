				<p>
					Welcome to my webpage!  As you might be able to tell, I am an avid horse lover.  As a result, I have been taking riding lessons since the age of seven, and competing since the 9th grade.  I have taken lessons at many barns throughout the metro detroit area, and have trained in a few of the many different riding disciplines.  As of now, I spend the school year riding hunter/jumper style with the Michigan Equestrian Team at Willowbrooke Farm, and breaks and summers at Windermere Equestrian Center.

				<p>
					When I was seven, I went horseback riding with my Girl Scout troop at Camp Innisfree (which has since <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/life/family/2014/09/18/michigan-girl-scout-camp-closing/15809081/">closed</a>).  I thoroughly enjoyed myself, so my mom signed me up to take lessons.  I spent about a year taking weekly lessons at the camp before I decided that I wasn't advancing to the level I wanted to be.  It was then that I moved to <a href="http://www.brilliantreflectionfarm.com">Brilliant Reflection Farm</a>, where I took bi-weekly dressage lessons.  I loved the barn, my trainer, and the horses I rode there (Alex and Thunder), but I dreamed of learning how to jump, which is not a part of dressage.  I took a year off of riding to pursue figure skating, but then decided I was ready to get back in the saddle.  I moved to <a href="http://www.biglakefarm.com">Big Lake Farm</a>, where a family friend was riding.  Long story short, I wanted be at a barn with more emphasis on competion and a jumping mindset, which Big Lake just didn't offer. When I was in the 7th grade I made a new friend at school that also rode and jumped horses, and I was very interested to find out where she rode.  She told me that she took lessons at <a href="http://windermereequestrian.com">Windermere Equestrian Center</a>, and my mom made an appointment for an evaluation lesson.  When I first got to Windermere I was amazed by how many horses there were, and how large the lesson program was.  When I rode, the owner, Miss Jen, said that I had lots to learn, and that she wanted me to get into a weekly lesson group.  I was sold on the place, and still call Windermere home to this day.  It is where I became the rider I am today.  I learned to jump and problem solve on a variety of different horses.  I love Windermere, and even though I would say I'm very confident on horseback, I know I still have much to learn.
